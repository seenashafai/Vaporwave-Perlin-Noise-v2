# Vaporwave-Perlin-Noise-v2
A cool visual journey made in Unity


TODO:

Make the journey infinite.
  CURRENTLY: Lasts around 5 minutes, and then reaches the end of the area and looks bad.
  ISSUE: I can't just make the area huge off the bat, as calculating and modifying the vertex values would be too costly
  SOLUTION: n/a
  
Create a menu
  CURRENTLY: There is no menu. The user cannot pause, restart or exit the application
  ISSUE: I have no idea how to do one. But it would involve pressing ESC and bringing up a transluscent menu somewhere on screen
  SOLUTION: n/a
  
Implement a nicer looking slider system
  CURRENTLY: The sliders are slighly pixellated and in general look unprofessional and don't fit the overall vibe of the application
  ISSUE: I'm considering allowing the user to use their mouse wheel to adjust the speed/amplitude- i.e. splitting the screen in half, and the mousewheel affects the relevant parameter depending on which side of the screen the mouse is on.
  SOLUTION: n/a
  
Create an app icon
  CURRENTLY: No app icon
  ISSUE: Need ideas, also not great at that type of thing
  
Create optional game music
  CURRENTLY: No game music
  ISSUE: Vaporwave music needs to fit a very specific style, and It's going to take some time to perfect it.
